In order for the acquired tan to last a long time, it is necessary to observe the following rules:

Sunbathing in the shade. In order not to harm the skin, it is necessary to sunbathe in the shade, that is, under the indirect rays of the sun. But in this case it will take more time to get a tan.

Take into account the individual characteristics of your skin. On a swarthy skin tan falls more quickly and lasts longer, so a white woman needs to first prepare the skin for sunburn. Start the process of preparation with the adoption of water procedures: baths, saunas, home baths with the addition of sea salt. In this case, the skin will be steamed, and the exfoliating agents will remove all dirt and keratinized particles. This procedure helps to get a faster and more even tan.

Use of special cosmetics. After the sun bathing, it is necessary to take care of the moisturizing of the skin. As already mentioned above, sun exposure to the skin leads to exfoliation of the upper layers of the epidermis.
