Welcome to MyBlog. I hope you will find the content useful and engaging.
Venus, which in the early era was almost a twin of the Earth, in its further evolution went another way. Therefore, Venus, like no other planet, allows us to see what the evolution of our planet could have been (or may be) under the influence of not yet fully understood external or internal causes. 

Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It occupies a special position among other planets of the terrestrial group. Until recently, it was called a twin of the Earth. The similarity between Venus and Earth in size and mass (and thus in density and gravity) suggests that the inner structure of the two planets is similar. However, the more advanced the study of Venus, the less it remained features of the "twin" of the Earth. 

Venus - the closest planet to the Earth, in its closest rapprochement it separates from the Earth only 40 million km. Light travels this distance in 2 minutes 12 seconds. But in this period we see only the night streak of the planet. We fully see its day time stature with the greatest distance of Venus from the Earth (260 million km).
